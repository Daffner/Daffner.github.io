	Story: Welcome to Haines House! It was here that the Concord Academy that we know today got its start in 1922. However, Concord Academy began not as a girls' high school in 1922, but as a co-ed elementary school around the corner on Belknap Street in 1916. Elite Concord families who hoped to have their children attend preparatory schools founded it to offer a more rigorous education than the local public elementary school provided. By 1922, students had started to age out of the school and parents wanted a local option for their daughters to continue a rigorous, if not entirely preparatory, education. While college was not a destination for all elite women at the time, it was an increasingly attractive and available option for young women who saw themselves in the "New Woman" movement of the 1920s. Designed primarily to serve a local student population, the fee structure used boarding tuition to subsidize day student attendance. Original day student fees ranged from $125 to $350 while boarding student tuition was $1500. Once the decision was made to open a high school on April 22nd of 1922, plans moved quickly. Haines house was bought on May 19th and Elise Hobson was hired as the new headmistress on May 27th. The high school opened in September of that year. In that first iteration, Haines House was used for classrooms, a dining hall, and teacher residences.
