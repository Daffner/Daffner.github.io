The Chapel is the heart of today’s CA. Nevertheless, it arrived at the school in a rather serendipitous manner. The story starts with the infamous 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston which claimed the lives of nearly 500 people. In the wake of that tragedy, more stringent fire regulations were imposed on all commercial and institutional buildings, including those at CA. To make the Assembly Hall--in what is now the lower portion of the Library--safer in the case of a fire, the local Fire Marshall insisted that the loose chairs then in use be attached to the floor. The recommended method for doing that was for the chairs to be attached to poles and the poles to be bolted to the floor. School leaders thought that would be too ugly and so they began a search for benches that could be attractively secured to the floor. CA wasn’t able to find used benches for sale in time and had to order brand new ones. But in the process of searching, a teacher came across an ad about an old Baptist church in New Hampshire that was to be sold along with its benches. Betty Hall drove up to check out the benches. What she found was something that she had been envisioning for the school for a while: a quiet meeting house. Using her own money, Hall bought the building, including its benches. Taking it apart, board by board, took three weeks, but with the help of several faculty members, one 9th grader, and 5 pet dogs, they managed (with the help of a crane) to achieve the onerous task in the summer of 1956.

Since finding its place at CA, the chapel has undergone multiple renovations and additions, notable among which was the steeple, built by students during the winter of 1960-1961. The iconic bell was installed a year later.

A major reconstruction was led by headmaster Jake Dresden and director of operations Don Kingman in 2004, which nearly doubled the chapel in size. When the renovation was complete, the chapel, now able to seat 420 people, had “enhanced acoustics, improved light, a higher ceiling, and soaring beams.”
