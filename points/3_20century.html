An iconic part of the chapel is this carved inscription: Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. This passage was traditionally read on the opening days of school. CA students carved them here in 1956. This carving is not, in fact, the first iteration. The original version turned out poorly. Molly Gregory, the woodcarving instructor, had assigned individual students their own line of the passage, resulting in visible differences between each line. Scrapping that first iteration, Gregory assigned individual students a single letter which they were responsible for carving throughout the entire piece. The result was consistency and beauty. Woodcarving students in subsequent years created many other items for the Chapel, including the altar of the chapel and this podium where CA faculty and students have been giving talks for decades. 

The acquisition of the Chapel and decisions about the physical plant of the school were part and parcel of the transformation that Betty Hall's leadership offered to CA. Before her tenure, CA was primarily what its founding families hoped for: a local school that would offer an intellectually stimulating education for daughters who may or may not go on to college educations. Betty Hall transformed the school into a rigorous preparatory school for girls, putting it on par with other nationally-known girls' schools and, in the process, frustrating and angering local parents whose daughters could no longer be assured of admissions. Betty Hall built the heart of the new CA, the Chapel, and put the school on the map.
