<mark>Story:</mark>

Along with co-education, CA experienced some of the social revolution that was rocking the world. Before becoming co-educational, CA had accepted its first students of color in 1968. Seven years later, CA had dedicated its most famous dance, “Whiteout,” a Concord Academy tradition in which all the students wear white clothing to dance with a blacklight, to an equal rights movement for African Americans. At the time of the dance in 1975, all the junior girls coordinated to wear black to support the protests against racial injustice. CA decided to honor this night by continuing the tradition for junior girls wearing all black to signify CA’s commitment to equality for all its members and bring equality to everybody treated unjustly. This being one of our more famous forms of activism, we see CA continue to support equality worldwide. Later in 1988 CA started its first GSA. With the help of its history Kevin Jennings concord was able to help represent students of the LGBTQ+ community. In comparison Phillips Academy Andover, was inspired by CA, which resulted in the formation of their GSA in 1989. As in 2019, CA supports the black lives movement, marches for climate change, and LGBTQ+ rights. CA has always been a school that values its community, even supporting its students as they help change the world one movement at a time.
