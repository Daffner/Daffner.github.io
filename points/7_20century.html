While looking over the ideas for co-education, one of the top ways to create such coeducation was to leave CA and move campus. It would be interesting if virtual reality were implemented to make CA disappear, giving the tour guide an appreciation for the campus staying where it is today. We can add pictures previous to CAâ€™s existence so we can visualize a desolate/abandoned CA.
<br>
We would also like a build-up to this point: in 1968-ish the girls of this school were aware of the political climate outside of concord and so we can add a point about how the girls protested against social injustice prior to becoming co-ed as it shows the school has a powerful social significance. This could be the place in which we can put in the idea of the junior girls dressing in all black for whiteout.
<br>
We believe a good transition point between Haines and the quad is necessary for understanding why leaving CA would be a bad idea, as we lose the active and bright students that make up the CA community.
