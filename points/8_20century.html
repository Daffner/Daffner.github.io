<mark>Story:</mark>

While looking through old yearbooks and old articles, I have found that there is an Eduardo Takas look alike. I believe it would be a great idea to recreate the photo and use it as a transition point, for coeducation. It will be a fun and quick way to move from one topic to another.

We believe this recreation can help showcase how far as a school we have grown, while also demonstrating a fun and unique way into talking about a serious topic such as Co-Education
