	     "The Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered large parts of Canada and the US 75,000 years ago, reached New England 25,000 years ago. When the climate started warming 21,000 years ago the Laurentide ice sheet began retreating from where it had reached, almost at the end of cape cod. By 12,000 years ago the ice sheet had completely retreated from Massachusetts, leaving new land formations and clay deposits, including Walden Pond in Concord, which is a 103ft deep kettle hole formed when the glacier melted 12,000 years ago. It was at this point that the first known inhabitants of Mass showed up, the Paleoindian Hunters.\n\n",
	     "The land on which you stand was, for thousands of native families, called Musketaquid, meaning \'grassy plain\' in Algonquian. Egg rock, an important landmark in Musketaquid, is just a short trip downstream from the riverbank where we stand now, located where the Sudbury and Assabet rivers conjoin to form the Concord River. The Nipmuc and Massachusett peoples used egg rock as a meeting place and many Concord locals have found artifacts buried in the soil over the years, with dates showing native people passing through and inhabiting the area around egg rock at least 10,000 years ago. One of the artifacts found was a fine axe head that has been dated to 6,000-3,000 Before the Present which was probably used for skinning animals. When it was in use, it may have looked like this axe which was handmade by Jonathan Perry in 2019, a member of the Aquinnah tribe of the Wampanoag people.\n\n",
	     "In the early 1600s, Tahattawan, the Nipmuc sachem who oversaw the area we are standing on today, was living across the Sudbury river on Nashawtuc Hill. He was old enough to have witnessed the plagues of the 1610s, which, as historian Barbara Robinson notes, had likely reduced the previously-thriving Musketaquid village to a mere handful of families by the time the English colonists set up a plantation in Concord in the 1630s. Contact with European disease in the decades prior had ravaged the local native populations. Squaw Sachem, a widowed female leader of the Massachusett, was known to have established close relations with English settlers, signing over use of land across Massachusetts in order to protect her shrinking population of people. She appears to have had partial or joint jurisdiction over this land. This turtle, constructed of artifacts collected in the Concord area and arranged in chronological order, shows the change in human populations in Musketaquid from 10,000 years ago to the 1600s. Elizabeth James-Perry, Aquinnah Wampanoag artist, designed the turtle shape, which is now on display at the Concord Museum. that way.\n\n",
	     "This is wampum. Initially, European settlers mistook wampum as a currency, likely from seeing it being used in trade. Thus, Europeans mass-produced wampum, hoping to gain an economic advantage. In fact, although wampum was used to exchange goods, it also held significance in recording events, and was a symbol of power. It was in this murky climate of miscommunication when, in 1635, the General Court of Massachusetts ordered the establishment of a six-square-mile plantation on the land of Musketaquid, to be named \"Concord.\" Two years later, according to English sources, a group of various native leaders, possibly ill-representative of the diversity of native peoples overall but including Squaw Sachem and Tahattawan, consented peacefully to the sale of land near Mill Brook in return for a flat return of wampum, tools, and various other goods. As tradition goes, they made this deal at Jethro\'s tree, less than half a mile down Main Street. The land on which Concord Academy sits was part of that initial agreement. A series of further so-called purchases were made in the decades following. Various scholars have theorized on what the \"sale\" of Musketaquid truly meant to the native leaders, if it may be called that: permission to share in its resources, a consent to cooperation, access to European markets and mutual protection against rival tribes. On the other hand, the concept of land capital as indicative of the magnitude of one\'s individual rights almost certainly held no weight to the indigenous peoples, though the imposition of that mindset would cause much strife between people groups in the centuries to come.\n\n",
	     "In the face of English settlement and diminishing populations, many natives chose to convert to Christianity, including Tahattawan himself, a known devout Protestant. Thus came the simultaneous exclusion and isolation of what came to be known as Praying Indian towns. Records of rules and regulations under which Praying Indians were to live suggest a general wariness from the English against truly accepting natives into their society while being worried that, \"unchecked,\" the natives would not learn Puritanism the \"correct\" way. Many English ministers put in great effort to maintain Christian ties in newly established Praying Indian towns, though those towns were often under-supplied. Shaky records exist of certain Praying Indian groups putting in petitions to legal sovereignty over small patches of land miles away from Great Meadow; whether these were granted, our research has left uncertain. Nonetheless, by the 1650s, many converted Concord Indians under Tahattawan had removed to Natick, Littleton, or various other Praying Indian towns across the colony. Tahattawan himself remained to help out the Nashoba Indians until his death shortly before King Philip\'s War.\n\n",
	     "It\'s a common misconception that the English colonists immediately bulldozed the land, to lay down plantations. It\'s true that beaver populations, for one, nearly went extinct after the arrival of the English. But, while the colonial settlers tried to replace one cultivated, native landscape with one of English husbandry, they in some ways knew the need to adapt to the existing land: to choose which practices could be implemented and which were useless, what parts of the land they could modify to their needs and which they did not need to, and this system appeared to have been somewhat well-meaning, at least within (upstanding) English communities, for a few years. The first cluster of houselots were closely gathered just east of what\'s now CA, along a set of Native corn farms, and grazing land was shared. After a brief depression in the 1640s, however, and when new settlement picked up steam in the 1650s, Concord\'s old proprietors began to worry that Concord\'s mostly non-privatized, common land ownership system would \"dilute\" their already-limited resources—even as pushes were being made to expand Concord\'s usable farmland, the most desirable parts were already in use. In 1653, they decided to divide the existing common land to private use based on how much of the non-commons land was owned: three acres of Second Division land for one acre of First. Many influential families claimed large generational farms during this division. As private ambitions grew, the English continuously balanced overwriting native culture with keeping them close enough to learn from their ways of working the land. As more land was privatized, colonists demanded new common grazing lands from the General Court. One notable incident resulted in them paying a group of Nashoba Indians whose land claims challenged the Colony\'s, in return for exclusive access to the land thereafter.\n\n",
	     "Simon Willard was a member of the first English families who took up permanent residence in Concord. He was a successful trader, and he learned the Algonquian language, gaining trust of many indigenous peoples. According to English sources, this became relevant during King Philip\'s War, when the now-Major Willard was welcomed by the Indians because he came with a commission from the honored Council to protect them. Simon Willard and his team immediately marched toward Wheeler and his companions when they were stuck in Marlborough. He stayed at Brookfield for a while, and he went for a time in the service of the country to buy other supplies for the regiment and secure its safety after a fight with the Nipmuc. However, Willard\'s story was told remarkably differently from the Nipmucs\' perspectives. During the blockade at Quaboag, the Nipmuc men destroyed all signs of English development when Willard had left. Then, they wounded two of Willard\'s men and their horses to prevent the military from following them when they returned to Menimesit. Finally, the Nipmucs burned the great Ayres barn, and they left at dawn on August 5. Although the Nipmucs showed their hostility and their strategy, they did not kill Willard and any of his people.\n\n",
	     "Sarah Doublet was an Indian woman and the daughter of Sagamore-John, the Chief of the Wamesit Praying Village. During their time in Deer Island, Sarah Doublet and her husband, Thomas Doublet, became members of a tribe that included 58 Praying Indians. These 58 Praying Indians resided in Concord under the protection of Mr. John Hoare, who provided shelter for all of them until the General Council of Boston demanded their removal to Deer Island. While it is unknown what happened to these 58 Praying Indians after their release from Deer Island, the survivors were given permission to return in 1677. These survivors included Sarah Doublet, her small family, and a few others. It wasn\'t until 1734 when Doublet was the last survivor of the Nashoba Plantation and thus, became the only heir to the 500 acres of land that was reserved for the Indian proprietors. According to an oral tradition, Sarah Doublet lived in a cave within this forest. While the cave does not appear to have a structure sustainable for someone to live in, this cave does correspond to the story of the chamber associated with other Indian activity, which indicates that this cave was used by Indians of the Nashoba Praying Indian Plantation era. Today, the land is known as the Sarah Doublet Forest, located in Littleton, MA.\n\n",
	     "Sarah Doublet became the only heir to the 500 acres of land located in Littleton, MA that was reserved for the Indian proprietors in 1714 due to the fact that she became the last survivor of  the Nashoba Plantation. The town then repaid me, Elnathan Jones Sr, with her land in exchange for Epraim Jones and me taking care of her as she grew more infirm in 1736. The inherited wealth was passed down to my son, who was born in 1736 and died on February 27, 1793. Jones Jr married Mary Minot Jones, born the eight child of Deacon Samual Minot of Concord in 1755 and together they continued to contribute to the Concord Society. Jr was a merchant with the East India Company and a member of the Social Circle who wrote that Jones was \"a merchant of irreproachable character, given to hospitality, and addicted to display\".\n\n",
	     /*10*/"Elnathan Jones Jr and his wife are mentioned as \"among the leading patriots.\" of Concord, and while he was working as an East India trader, he greatly aided the cause for liberty. In early 1775, Jr stored 20,000 pounds of musket balls and cartridges as well as thousands of other items and munitions for the war effort in his store. \"Hearing of these stores, the British sent out an expedition from Boston to seize them. But when the soldiers came to the East India Warehouse where many supplies were concealed, Mary Minott was equal to the occasion. She invited the British officers into her parlor, served them the best wine, and entertained them with games of cards played on her mahogany table. Her fascinating and charming hospitality proved so attractive that her guests forgot all about the supplies until the patriots had sufficient time to remove them to a place of safety.\" The Jones Legacy and name lived on in Concord as their land eventually became part of Concord Academy. With wealth inherited from Sarah Doublet\'s property in Littleton, Elnathan Jones Sr. purchased this land, and his son, Elnathan Jones Jr, inherited it from him after his death, and he lived on this land once owned by the Nipmuc tribe. As the revolutionary war broke, the fate of this land became uncertain, but thanks to the bravery of Concord Residents, liberty prevailed. Concord\'s history is long and complicated, but it leads back to a few common denominators.\n\n",/*early10*/
	     "Tourists generally do not come to Concord these days to explore its industrial history. They are more familiar with stories about its 19th century thinkers and abolitionists, Thoreau chief among them. What was true, however, is that the manufacturing economy and abolitionism went hand-in-hand in the 19th Century, for factory operatives in large mill towns like Lowell as well as for the mechanics and intellectuals in smaller centers of production like Concord. Many of the well known abolitionists were also manufacturers. Whiting and Thoreau, two of the residents who were involved in manufacturing, were also prominent abolitionists. By the mid 1830s, with his carriage business flourishing, Colonel William Whiting built this house at 204 Main Street. His economic success allowed him the time to become deeply involved in the nascent abolition movement. Whiting was a regular reader of \'The Liberator,\' a radical abolitionist newspaper, a president of the Middlesex County Anti-Slavery Society, and one of the vice presidents of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Additionally, he was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, which protected escaped slaves from being kidnapped. His involvement in all of these abolitionist organizations illustrate his commitment to the movement. Now, it\'s interesting to think about the idea of a guy who has these two things that are true about him: he is both a mechanic--someone who made his wealth by practicing a trade--and he had the interest and could afford to take on time-consuming and radical activities in the abolitionist movement. Although Whiting was an active abolitionist, and his work in the movement was great, what stands out in the history of abolitionism in Concord is the work of Concord\'s abolitionist girl bosses.\n\n",
	     "While Whiting\'s commitment to abolition was laudable, the majority of radical abolitionists in 19th century Concord were women. William Whiting\'s daughter, Anna Maria Whiting, who is the first girlboss in our story, and Frank Sanborn, one of the \"Secret Six\" supporters of abolitionist John Brown. Anna Maria Whiting lived on 49 Sudbury Road, a block away from her father. She was a member of Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society and wrote for the Liberator and the Herald of Freedom. In 1860, federal officials attempted to arrest Frank Sanborn in Concord for his involvement with the raid on Harpers Ferry. Anna Maria Whiting did her best to stop them from doing so. A letter between Ralph Waldo Emerson\'s daughters reported that, \"Miss Anne Whiting got into the carriage and held the door and put herself in the way, and fought with a cane, and so prevented them from getting Mr. Sanborn in. The men hurt her and scratched her and tore her dress trying to get her out, but she stayed in and hindered them a long time.\" It\'s a very dramatic scene, showing Anna Maria Whiting\'s strong commitment to activism. Concord\'s Girl Bosses were, in fact, more radical abolitionists than their menfolk. Anna Maria Whiting willingly threw herself into a physically dangerous situation to stick up for what she believed was right.\n\n",
	     "Now we come to our second girlboss, Mary Merrick Brooks. Mary Merrick Brooks helped found the Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society in 1837 and championed Garrisonian immediatism. Garrisonian immediatists wanted to get rid of slavery immediately, as opposed to gradually ending it over a period of years. Mary and her husband Nathan Brooks, a lawyer, lived in a house that was at the location today\'s Concord Free Public Library. As a practitioner of the law, Nathan Brooks was unable to commit publicly to the kind of strong antislavery stance that his wife maintained. He was initially hesitant to help when she was assisting fugitive slaves, as it was illegal, but he never interfered with her activism. Indeed, he helped her fund the Female Antislavery Society, which she was a founding member of. Concord\'s affluenence, and the wealth that many of the Concord residents possessed, allowed them (or their wives and daughters) to be active and outspoken about abolishing slavery. With the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, which forced local authorities and all citizens to assist in the capture of runaway slaves, Mary Merrick Brooks redoubled efforts underway to fund the Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society. Brooks raised money with a cake called \"Brooks Cake\" and by making quilts. Brooks, along with others in the Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society, were instrumental in bringing famous abolitionists like Frederick Douglass, Harriett Tubman, and John Brown to Concord. These famous abolitionist speakers all visited the houses of the people along this very street that you are walking on.\n\n",
	     "Another Girlboss and member of the Concord Female Antislavery Society, was Ann Bigelow. Her story is one of generosity and moral choice. Shadrach Minkins escaped slavery in Virginia in early 1850, the year of the Fugitive Slave Act, and was living in Boston. He was working at Cornhill Coffee House and Tavern on Beacon Hill. However, in the early morning on February 15, 1851, Minkins was seized and handcuffed by an Assistant Deputy and taken to the U.S. Courthouse. The word of his capture had soon spread to abolitionists, and in half an hour, a furious mob had rushed the courtroom door and demanded answers. About 20 men ran inside, grabbed Minkins \"by the collar and feet\" and left, managing to flee the authorities due to the size and hostility of the crowd. Minkins was hidden in multiple houses before ending up in Ann & Francis Bigelow\'s house on 19 Sudbury Rd. When Ann asked Mary Merrick Brooks for help, her husband, Nathan, came with her to the Bigelow house, unaware that they were harboring a fugitive slave and still unwilling to assist in his wife\'s illegal activities. However, once he saw Minkins in such a horrible condition, he had a change of heart, and gave Minkins his own hat and clothes as a disguise. After Minkins was disguised, Francis Bigelow took him to Leominster, where he stayed with another family shortly before going to Canada.\n\n",
	     "Our final Girl Boss is the only black founder of the Concord Female Antislavery Society: Susan Robbins Garrison. She hosted at least one meeting of the society at her house, the Robbins House, which you can visit today across from the Old North Bridge. Susan was the daughter and the wife of men who had been enslaved. She had a sharp interest in ending slavery. Her children were the top scholars in the Concord Public Schools. Her children went on to be major antislavery activists, working with William Lloyd Garrison in Boston. Her son, Jack, Jr., was elected to public office in Concord. One daughter, Ellen, taught in Freedmen\'s schools in the south and became the first person to bring a suit in federal court to challenge segregation in public transportation (the case was thrown out). So, as a woman and as a mother and as a Black person, she was in fact a Girlboss. As we come to the end of our tour, we hope you were able to learn about Concord as a manufacturing town and a center of abolitionist activism in the 19th Century. One thing that we hope you can take away from this journey is the vital role that women played in the abolitionist movement and how they were oftentimes more radical than the men in their lives. What\'s interesting to note is the role that education played; we particularly see this emphasis on education and the link between education and empowerment when we consider the story of Susan Robbins Garrison and her children. Despite most of them not having access to rigorous formal education, the Concord Girlbosses had strong moral compasses, and used the free time that (for most of them) their middle class lives afforded them to spend on abolitionist activism and in helping fugitive slaves.\n\n",
	     "Welcome to Main Street Concord! This tour will examine the manufacturing businesses that built some of these giant 19th century houses, and their relationship to the abolitionist movement. William Whiting, a carriage maker and, in his later life, an ardent abolitionist, lived at 169 Main St. Whiting learned his craft from Henry Sanderson, a harness maker and carriage trimmer.  At the young age of 20, (the usual age when 19th century craftsmen left their masters\' shops was 21, and then, only to become journeymen workers) he rented a shop and began work as a master with one apprentice. Later, in 1831 and 1832, his business of carriage making became extensive and his business was booming. His customers came not only from Concord, but almost every city and town throughout Massachusetts. People even came from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and some from far off New Orleans to purchase his carriages. The wealth that his manufacturing business generated built his house and shop at this location.\n\n",
	     /*19c7*/"Across Academy Lane from William Whiting\'s carriage factory, was William Munroe\'s pencil manufactory. Munroe received little formal schooling, and from a young age, he began work as a farm hand and a wheelwright\'s assistant, but neither lasted long. At the age of 15, his father apprenticed him to a cabinet maker, a trade which, in his journal, Munroe wrote would be a \"profitable\" and \"desirable\" business. At the end of his apprenticeship, Munroe became a journeyman cabinet maker in his brother Daniel\'s clockmaking business located in the center of Concord, using his cabinet-making skills to craft clock cases. He was remarkably skillful and, as clocks were wildly popular in the new Republic, he was successful.  Munroe later translated his woodworking skill into pencil making and became one of the most successful pencil manufacturers of the 19th century. At his factory at 185 Main Street, he created wood-cased graphite pencils that we are familiar with in modern times. After much experimentation, Munroe developed a secret graphite mixture recipe, helping him grow his business. However, the well-known Henry David Thoreau and the rest of the Thoreau family, down the street, were competitors in pencil making.\n\n",
	     "Welcome to Haines House! It was here that the Concord Academy that we know today got its start in 1922. However, Concord Academy began not as a girls\' high school in 1922, but as a co-ed elementary school around the corner on Belknap Street in 1916. Elite Concord families who hoped to have their children attend preparatory schools founded it to offer a more rigorous education than the local public elementary school provided. By 1922, students had started to age out of the school and parents wanted a local option for their daughters to continue a rigorous, if not entirely preparatory, education. While college was not a destination for all elite women at the time, it was an increasingly attractive and available option for young women who saw themselves in the \"New Woman\" movement of the 1920s. Designed primarily to serve a local student population, the fee structure used boarding tuition to subsidize day student attendance. Original day student fees ranged from $125 to $350 while boarding student tuition was $1500. Once the decision was made to open a high school on April 22nd of 1922, plans moved quickly. Haines house was bought on May 19th and Elise Hobson was hired as the new headmistress on May 27th. The high school opened in September of that year. In that first iteration, Haines House was used for classrooms, a dining hall, and teacher residences.\n\n",
             "The Chapel is the heart of today\'s CA. Nevertheless, it arrived at the school in a rather serendipitous manner. The story starts with the infamous 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston which claimed the lives of nearly 500 people. In the wake of that tragedy, more stringent fire regulations were imposed on all commercial and institutional buildings, including those at CA. To make the Assembly Hall--in what is now the lower portion of the Library--safer in the case of a fire, the local Fire Marshall insisted that the loose chairs then in use be attached to the floor. The recommended method for doing that was for the chairs to be attached to poles and the poles to be bolted to the floor. School leaders thought that would be too ugly and so they began a search for benches that could be attractively secured to the floor. CA wasn’t able to find used benches for sale in time and had to order brand new ones. But in the process of searching, a teacher came across an ad about an old Baptist church in New Hampshire that was to be sold along with its benches. Betty Hall drove up to check out the benches. What she found was something that she had been envisioning for the school for a while: a quiet meeting house. Using her own money, Hall bought the building, including its benches. Taking it apart, board by board, took three weeks, but with the help of several faculty members, one 9th grader, and 5 pet dogs, they managed (with the help of a crane) to achieve the onerous task in the summer of 1956. Since finding its place at CA, the chapel has undergone multiple renovations and additions, notable among which was the steeple, built by students during the winter of 1960-1961. The iconic bell was installed a year later. A major reconstruction was led by headmaster Jake Dresden and director of operations Don Kingman in 2004, which nearly doubled the chapel in size. When the renovation was complete, the chapel, now able to seat 420 people, had \"enhanced acoustics, improved light, a higher ceiling, and soaring beams.\"\n\n",
             "An iconic part of the chapel is this carved inscription: Paul\'s first letter to the Corinthians. This passage was traditionally read on the opening days of school. CA students carved them here in 1956. This carving is not, in fact, the first iteration. The original version turned out poorly. Molly Gregory, the woodcarving instructor, had assigned individual students their own line of the passage, resulting in visible differences between each line. Scrapping that first iteration, Gregory assigned individual students a single letter which they were responsible for carving throughout the entire piece. The result was consistency and beauty. Woodcarving students in subsequent years created many other items for the Chapel, including the altar of the chapel and this podium where CA faculty and students have been giving talks for decades. The acquisition of the Chapel and decisions about the physical plant of the school were part and parcel of the transformation that Betty Hall's leadership offered to CA. Before her tenure, CA was primarily what its founding families hoped for: a local school that would offer an intellectually stimulating education for daughters who may or may not go on to college educations. Betty Hall transformed the school into a rigorous preparatory school for girls, putting it on par with other nationally-known girls' schools and, in the process, frustrating and angering local parents whose daughters could no longer be assured of admissions. Betty Hall built the heart of the new CA, the Chapel, and put the school on the map.\n\n",
             "Mrs. Hall\'s changes to CA campus were not limited to building the Chapel. During her tenure, the Stufac was also transformed. Entering the Stufac, you might assume that it was always a dining hall, but you\'d be wrong. This was Concord Academy’s first gym. Prior to the 1950s, the dining hall was located in Russell Robb, an older building that was demolished to make way for the SHAC, while the current Stufac was instead used as a gymnasium. Primarily used for sports practice and games, the space also served as an auditorium. As you can see on your devices, the stage was set against the north wall. CA\'s first play, Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado, was performed here. After 1950, the gym went under major renovations, converting it into a dining hall. A second floor was constructed--now referred to as the upper stufac--as a place for students to be in each other’s company; students could take books from the newly installed bookshelves or hang out on couches with each other. Like the chameleon mascot that represents CA's adaptability, the school in its physical plant and in its national reach, reinvented itself in the second part of the 20th century.\n\n",
             "As it reached its fiftieth year, CA faced an existential crisis. If things had gone differently, it\'s entirely possible that the school would not exist today, that the houses along Main Street would be just that, residential houses, and it would have looked as though CA was never here. You may be asking yourself why? Well, in 1969, CA confronted the same quandary as other prep schools: what to do about the swelling wave of co-education that was transforming both university and secondary education? If we had left this campus, it\'s likely that this valuable real estate in the center of town would have become a neighborhood like the adjacent ones. Well, by 1969 the vast majority of all-boys and all-girls schools had gone or were planning to go co-ed; Concord was under pressure to follow suit. Various plans were considered, such as: exchanging students with other nearby schools, sharing nearby school grounds, becoming a co-ed school by itself, staying in an all-girls school, or, most drastically, merging with an all-boys school. Many girls\' schools decided to take the latter option. CA had lots of offers; Groton and Middlesex both pressed their suits hard. After long contemplation, school leaders decided to maintain CA\'s independence and become co-ed on its own. Co-education was a major change. Boys joined CA in 1971. On your device, you can see some photos of the first male students at CA. We thought it would be interesting to recreate these images with current students, in a world in which CA welcomes students of all genders.\n\n",
             "Along with co-education, CA experienced some of the social revolution that was rocking the world. Before becoming co-educational, CA had accepted its first students of color in 1963. Twelve years later, CA had dedicated its most famous dance, “Whiteout,” a Concord Academy tradition in which all the students wear white clothing to dance with a blacklight, to an equal rights movement for African Americans. At the time of the dance in 1975, all the junior girls coordinated to wear black to support the protests against racial injustice. CA decided to honor this night by continuing the tradition for junior girls wearing all black to signify CA’s commitment to equality for all its members and bring equality to everybody treated unjustly. This being one of our more famous forms of activism, we see CA continue to support equality worldwide. Later in 1988 CA started its first GSA. With the help of history teacher Kevin Jennings, Concord was able to represent students of the LGBTQ+ community. In comparison Phillips Academy Andover, was inspired by CA, which resulted in the formation of their GSA in 1989. In recent years, CA has supported the black lives movement, marched for climate change, and LGBTQ+ rights. CA has always been a school that values its community, even supporting its students as they help change the world one movement at a time.\n\n",
             "This is the site of one of the two original senior houses, one of the first, but failed attempts, at developing co-educational residences at Concord Academy. Ben Stumpf, now the computer science teacher at CA, lived in this Senior house while he was a student here. Today, CA residential life is grappling not just with how to best co-educate the houses, but how to accommodate and welcome boarding students who are trans or gender non-conforming into a boarding program that has traditionally conformed to the gender binary. The process has prompted the community to scrutinize the way that gender informs and shapes how we create and use social spaces on campus and come to new and more flexible approaches that fit the community that we are today and that affirm all of the students who call CA home.\n\n",
             "nothing",
             "Concord Academy\'s transition from a local elementary school, to a local girls' high school, to a national girls\' boarding school, to an international boarding and day school is the result of the love and commitment of its students, families, faculty, staff, and school leaders. Its footprint has expanded over time from its origins at 185 Main Street to stretch from the border of downtown at Wheeler House to the shore of the Sudbury River at Toad Hall, and the Moriarty Athletic Campus out at the old Arena Farms. The school continues to reimagine and reinvent itself with each new generation of students and adults. The immediate future will hopefully include a revitalization of West Campus and the building of the new Arts Building on the parking lot you see in front of you. It will be exciting to see how the next generation of Chameleons transforms this landscape and themselves.\n\n"

	     "The Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered large parts of Canada and the US 75,000 years ago, reached New England 25,000 years ago. When the climate started warming 21,000 years ago the Laurentide ice sheet began retreating from where it had reached, almost at the end of cape cod. By 12,000 years ago the ice sheet had completely retreated from Massachusetts, leaving new land formations and clay deposits, including Walden Pond in Concord, which is a 103ft deep kettle hole formed when the glacier melted 12,000 years ago. It was at this point that the first known inhabitants of Mass showed up, the Paleoindian Hunters.",
	     "The land on which you stand was, for thousands of native families, called Musketaquid, meaning \'grassy plain\' in Algonquian. Egg rock, an important landmark in Musketaquid, is just a short trip downstream from the riverbank where we stand now, located where the Sudbury and Assabet rivers conjoin to form the Concord River. The Nipmuc and Massachusett peoples used egg rock as a meeting place and many Concord locals have found artifacts buried in the soil over the years, with dates showing native people passing through and inhabiting the area around egg rock at least 10,000 years ago. One of the artifacts found was a fine axe head that has been dated to 6,000-3,000 Before the Present which was probably used for skinning animals. When it was in use, it may have looked like this axe which was handmade by Jonathan Perry in 2019, a member of the Aquinnah tribe of the Wampanoag people.",
	     "In the early 1600s, Tahattawan, the Nipmuc sachem who oversaw the area we are standing on today, was living across the Sudbury river on Nashawtuc Hill. He was old enough to have witnessed the plagues of the 1610s, which, as historian Barbara Robinson notes, had likely reduced the previously-thriving Musketaquid village to a mere handful of families by the time the English colonists set up a plantation in Concord in the 1630s. Contact with European disease in the decades prior had ravaged the local native populations. Squaw Sachem, a widowed female leader of the Massachusett, was known to have established close relations with English settlers, signing over use of land across Massachusetts in order to protect her shrinking population of people. She appears to have had partial or joint jurisdiction over this land. This turtle, constructed of artifacts collected in the Concord area and arranged in chronological order, shows the change in human populations in Musketaquid from 10,000 years ago to the 1600s. Elizabeth James-Perry, Aquinnah Wampanoag artist, designed the turtle shape, which is now on display at the Concord Museum. that way.",
	     "This is wampum. Initially, European settlers mistook wampum as a currency, likely from seeing it being used in trade. Thus, Europeans mass-produced wampum, hoping to gain an economic advantage. In fact, although wampum was used to exchange goods, it also held significance in recording events, and was a symbol of power. It was in this murky climate of miscommunication when, in 1635, the General Court of Massachusetts ordered the establishment of a six-square-mile plantation on the land of Musketaquid, to be named \"Concord.\" Two years later, according to English sources, a group of various native leaders, possibly ill-representative of the diversity of native peoples overall but including Squaw Sachem and Tahattawan, consented peacefully to the sale of land near Mill Brook in return for a flat return of wampum, tools, and various other goods. As tradition goes, they made this deal at Jethro\'s tree, less than half a mile down Main Street. The land on which Concord Academy sits was part of that initial agreement. A series of further so-called purchases were made in the decades following. Various scholars have theorized on what the \"sale\" of Musketaquid truly meant to the native leaders, if it may be called that: permission to share in its resources, a consent to cooperation, access to European markets and mutual protection against rival tribes. On the other hand, the concept of land capital as indicative of the magnitude of one\'s individual rights almost certainly held no weight to the indigenous peoples, though the imposition of that mindset would cause much strife between people groups in the centuries to come.",
	     "In the face of English settlement and diminishing populations, many natives chose to convert to Christianity, including Tahattawan himself, a known devout Protestant. Thus came the simultaneous exclusion and isolation of what came to be known as Praying Indian towns. Records of rules and regulations under which Praying Indians were to live suggest a general wariness from the English against truly accepting natives into their society while being worried that, \"unchecked,\" the natives would not learn Puritanism the \"correct\" way. Many English ministers put in great effort to maintain Christian ties in newly established Praying Indian towns, though those towns were often under-supplied. Shaky records exist of certain Praying Indian groups putting in petitions to legal sovereignty over small patches of land miles away from Great Meadow; whether these were granted, our research has left uncertain. Nonetheless, by the 1650s, many converted Concord Indians under Tahattawan had removed to Natick, Littleton, or various other Praying Indian towns across the colony. Tahattawan himself remained to help out the Nashoba Indians until his death shortly before King Philip\'s War.",
	     "It\'s a common misconception that the English colonists immediately bulldozed the land, to lay down plantations. It\'s true that beaver populations, for one, nearly went extinct after the arrival of the English. But, while the colonial settlers tried to replace one cultivated, native landscape with one of English husbandry, they in some ways knew the need to adapt to the existing land: to choose which practices could be implemented and which were useless, what parts of the land they could modify to their needs and which they did not need to, and this system appeared to have been somewhat well-meaning, at least within (upstanding) English communities, for a few years. The first cluster of houselots were closely gathered just east of what\'s now CA, along a set of Native corn farms, and grazing land was shared. After a brief depression in the 1640s, however, and when new settlement picked up steam in the 1650s, Concord\'s old proprietors began to worry that Concord\'s mostly non-privatized, common land ownership system would \"dilute\" their already-limited resources—even as pushes were being made to expand Concord\'s usable farmland, the most desirable parts were already in use. In 1653, they decided to divide the existing common land to private use based on how much of the non-commons land was owned: three acres of Second Division land for one acre of First. Many influential families claimed large generational farms during this division. As private ambitions grew, the English continuously balanced overwriting native culture with keeping them close enough to learn from their ways of working the land. As more land was privatized, colonists demanded new common grazing lands from the General Court. One notable incident resulted in them paying a group of Nashoba Indians whose land claims challenged the Colony\'s, in return for exclusive access to the land thereafter.",
	     "Simon Willard was a member of the first English families who took up permanent residence in Concord. He was a successful trader, and he learned the Algonquian language, gaining trust of many indigenous peoples. According to English sources, this became relevant during King Philip\'s War, when the now-Major Willard was welcomed by the Indians because he came with a commission from the honored Council to protect them. Simon Willard and his team immediately marched toward Wheeler and his companions when they were stuck in Marlborough. He stayed at Brookfield for a while, and he went for a time in the service of the country to buy other supplies for the regiment and secure its safety after a fight with the Nipmuc. However, Willard\'s story was told remarkably differently from the Nipmucs\' perspectives. During the blockade at Quaboag, the Nipmuc men destroyed all signs of English development when Willard had left. Then, they wounded two of Willard\'s men and their horses to prevent the military from following them when they returned to Menimesit. Finally, the Nipmucs burned the great Ayres barn, and they left at dawn on August 5. Although the Nipmucs showed their hostility and their strategy, they did not kill Willard and any of his people.",
	     "Sarah Doublet was an Indian woman and the daughter of Sagamore-John, the Chief of the Wamesit Praying Village. During their time in Deer Island, Sarah Doublet and her husband, Thomas Doublet, became members of a tribe that included 58 Praying Indians. These 58 Praying Indians resided in Concord under the protection of Mr. John Hoare, who provided shelter for all of them until the General Council of Boston demanded their removal to Deer Island. While it is unknown what happened to these 58 Praying Indians after their release from Deer Island, the survivors were given permission to return in 1677. These survivors included Sarah Doublet, her small family, and a few others. It wasn\'t until 1734 when Doublet was the last survivor of the Nashoba Plantation and thus, became the only heir to the 500 acres of land that was reserved for the Indian proprietors. According to an oral tradition, Sarah Doublet lived in a cave within this forest. While the cave does not appear to have a structure sustainable for someone to live in, this cave does correspond to the story of the chamber associated with other Indian activity, which indicates that this cave was used by Indians of the Nashoba Praying Indian Plantation era. Today, the land is known as the Sarah Doublet Forest, located in Littleton, MA.",
	     "Sarah Doublet became the only heir to the 500 acres of land located in Littleton, MA that was reserved for the Indian proprietors in 1714 due to the fact that she became the last survivor of  the Nashoba Plantation. The town then repaid me, Elnathan Jones Sr, with her land in exchange for Epraim Jones and me taking care of her as she grew more infirm in 1736. The inherited wealth was passed down to my son, who was born in 1736 and died on February 27, 1793. Jones Jr married Mary Minot Jones, born the eight child of Deacon Samual Minot of Concord in 1755 and together they continued to contribute to the Concord Society. Jr was a merchant with the East India Company and a member of the Social Circle who wrote that Jones was \"a merchant of irreproachable character, given to hospitality, and addicted to display\".",
	     /*10*/"Elnathan Jones Jr and his wife are mentioned as \"among the leading patriots.\" of Concord, and while he was working as an East India trader, he greatly aided the cause for liberty. In early 1775, Jr stored 20,000 pounds of musket balls and cartridges as well as thousands of other items and munitions for the war effort in his store. \"Hearing of these stores, the British sent out an expedition from Boston to seize them. But when the soldiers came to the East India Warehouse where many supplies were concealed, Mary Minott was equal to the occasion. She invited the British officers into her parlor, served them the best wine, and entertained them with games of cards played on her mahogany table. Her fascinating and charming hospitality proved so attractive that her guests forgot all about the supplies until the patriots had sufficient time to remove them to a place of safety.\" The Jones Legacy and name lived on in Concord as their land eventually became part of Concord Academy. With wealth inherited from Sarah Doublet\'s property in Littleton, Elnathan Jones Sr. purchased this land, and his son, Elnathan Jones Jr, inherited it from him after his death, and he lived on this land once owned by the Nipmuc tribe. As the revolutionary war broke, the fate of this land became uncertain, but thanks to the bravery of Concord Residents, liberty prevailed. Concord\'s history is long and complicated, but it leads back to a few common denominators.",/*early10*/
	     "Tourists generally do not come to Concord these days to explore its industrial history. They are more familiar with stories about its 19th century thinkers and abolitionists, Thoreau chief among them. What was true, however, is that the manufacturing economy and abolitionism went hand-in-hand in the 19th Century, for factory operatives in large mill towns like Lowell as well as for the mechanics and intellectuals in smaller centers of production like Concord. Many of the well known abolitionists were also manufacturers. Whiting and Thoreau, two of the residents who were involved in manufacturing, were also prominent abolitionists. By the mid 1830s, with his carriage business flourishing, Colonel William Whiting built this house at 204 Main Street. His economic success allowed him the time to become deeply involved in the nascent abolition movement. Whiting was a regular reader of \'The Liberator,\' a radical abolitionist newspaper, a president of the Middlesex County Anti-Slavery Society, and one of the vice presidents of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Additionally, he was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, which protected escaped slaves from being kidnapped. His involvement in all of these abolitionist organizations illustrate his commitment to the movement. Now, it\'s interesting to think about the idea of a guy who has these two things that are true about him: he is both a mechanic--someone who made his wealth by practicing a trade--and he had the interest and could afford to take on time-consuming and radical activities in the abolitionist movement. Although Whiting was an active abolitionist, and his work in the movement was great, what stands out in the history of abolitionism in Concord is the work of Concord\'s abolitionist girl bosses.",
	     "While Whiting\'s commitment to abolition was laudable, the majority of radical abolitionists in 19th century Concord were women. William Whiting\'s daughter, Anna Maria Whiting, who is the first girlboss in our story, and Frank Sanborn, one of the \"Secret Six\" supporters of abolitionist John Brown. Anna Maria Whiting lived on 49 Sudbury Road, a block away from her father. She was a member of Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society and wrote for the Liberator and the Herald of Freedom. In 1860, federal officials attempted to arrest Frank Sanborn in Concord for his involvement with the raid on Harpers Ferry. Anna Maria Whiting did her best to stop them from doing so. A letter between Ralph Waldo Emerson\'s daughters reported that, \"Miss Anne Whiting got into the carriage and held the door and put herself in the way, and fought with a cane, and so prevented them from getting Mr. Sanborn in. The men hurt her and scratched her and tore her dress trying to get her out, but she stayed in and hindered them a long time.\" It\'s a very dramatic scene, showing Anna Maria Whiting\'s strong commitment to activism. Concord\'s Girl Bosses were, in fact, more radical abolitionists than their menfolk. Anna Maria Whiting willingly threw herself into a physically dangerous situation to stick up for what she believed was right.",
	     "Now we come to our second girlboss, Mary Merrick Brooks. Mary Merrick Brooks helped found the Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society in 1837 and championed Garrisonian immediatism. Garrisonian immediatists wanted to get rid of slavery immediately, as opposed to gradually ending it over a period of years. Mary and her husband Nathan Brooks, a lawyer, lived in a house that was at the location today\'s Concord Free Public Library. As a practitioner of the law, Nathan Brooks was unable to commit publicly to the kind of strong antislavery stance that his wife maintained. He was initially hesitant to help when she was assisting fugitive slaves, as it was illegal, but he never interfered with her activism. Indeed, he helped her fund the Female Antislavery Society, which she was a founding member of. Concord\'s affluenence, and the wealth that many of the Concord residents possessed, allowed them (or their wives and daughters) to be active and outspoken about abolishing slavery. With the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, which forced local authorities and all citizens to assist in the capture of runaway slaves, Mary Merrick Brooks redoubled efforts underway to fund the Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society. Brooks raised money with a cake called \"Brooks Cake\" and by making quilts. Brooks, along with others in the Concord Ladies\' Antislavery Society, were instrumental in bringing famous abolitionists like Frederick Douglass, Harriett Tubman, and John Brown to Concord. These famous abolitionist speakers all visited the houses of the people along this very street that you are walking on.",
	     "Another Girlboss and member of the Concord Female Antislavery Society, was Ann Bigelow. Her story is one of generosity and moral choice. Shadrach Minkins escaped slavery in Virginia in early 1850, the year of the Fugitive Slave Act, and was living in Boston. He was working at Cornhill Coffee House and Tavern on Beacon Hill. However, in the early morning on February 15, 1851, Minkins was seized and handcuffed by an Assistant Deputy and taken to the U.S. Courthouse. The word of his capture had soon spread to abolitionists, and in half an hour, a furious mob had rushed the courtroom door and demanded answers. About 20 men ran inside, grabbed Minkins \"by the collar and feet\" and left, managing to flee the authorities due to the size and hostility of the crowd. Minkins was hidden in multiple houses before ending up in Ann & Francis Bigelow\'s house on 19 Sudbury Rd. When Ann asked Mary Merrick Brooks for help, her husband, Nathan, came with her to the Bigelow house, unaware that they were harboring a fugitive slave and still unwilling to assist in his wife\'s illegal activities. However, once he saw Minkins in such a horrible condition, he had a change of heart, and gave Minkins his own hat and clothes as a disguise. After Minkins was disguised, Francis Bigelow took him to Leominster, where he stayed with another family shortly before going to Canada.",
	     "Our final Girl Boss is the only black founder of the Concord Female Antislavery Society: Susan Robbins Garrison. She hosted at least one meeting of the society at her house, the Robbins House, which you can visit today across from the Old North Bridge. Susan was the daughter and the wife of men who had been enslaved. She had a sharp interest in ending slavery. Her children were the top scholars in the Concord Public Schools. Her children went on to be major antislavery activists, working with William Lloyd Garrison in Boston. Her son, Jack, Jr., was elected to public office in Concord. One daughter, Ellen, taught in Freedmen\'s schools in the south and became the first person to bring a suit in federal court to challenge segregation in public transportation (the case was thrown out). So, as a woman and as a mother and as a Black person, she was in fact a Girlboss. As we come to the end of our tour, we hope you were able to learn about Concord as a manufacturing town and a center of abolitionist activism in the 19th Century. One thing that we hope you can take away from this journey is the vital role that women played in the abolitionist movement and how they were oftentimes more radical than the men in their lives. What\'s interesting to note is the role that education played; we particularly see this emphasis on education and the link between education and empowerment when we consider the story of Susan Robbins Garrison and her children. Despite most of them not having access to rigorous formal education, the Concord Girlbosses had strong moral compasses, and used the free time that (for most of them) their middle class lives afforded them to spend on abolitionist activism and in helping fugitive slaves.",
	     "Welcome to Main Street Concord! This tour will examine the manufacturing businesses that built some of these giant 19th century houses, and their relationship to the abolitionist movement. William Whiting, a carriage maker and, in his later life, an ardent abolitionist, lived at 169 Main St. Whiting learned his craft from Henry Sanderson, a harness maker and carriage trimmer.  At the young age of 20, (the usual age when 19th century craftsmen left their masters\' shops was 21, and then, only to become journeymen workers) he rented a shop and began work as a master with one apprentice. Later, in 1831 and 1832, his business of carriage making became extensive and his business was booming. His customers came not only from Concord, but almost every city and town throughout Massachusetts. People even came from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and some from far off New Orleans to purchase his carriages. The wealth that his manufacturing business generated built his house and shop at this location.",
	     /*19c7*/"Across Academy Lane from William Whiting\'s carriage factory, was William Munroe\'s pencil manufactory. Munroe received little formal schooling, and from a young age, he began work as a farm hand and a wheelwright\'s assistant, but neither lasted long. At the age of 15, his father apprenticed him to a cabinet maker, a trade which, in his journal, Munroe wrote would be a \"profitable\" and \"desirable\" business. At the end of his apprenticeship, Munroe became a journeyman cabinet maker in his brother Daniel\'s clockmaking business located in the center of Concord, using his cabinet-making skills to craft clock cases. He was remarkably skillful and, as clocks were wildly popular in the new Republic, he was successful.  Munroe later translated his woodworking skill into pencil making and became one of the most successful pencil manufacturers of the 19th century. At his factory at 185 Main Street, he created wood-cased graphite pencils that we are familiar with in modern times. After much experimentation, Munroe developed a secret graphite mixture recipe, helping him grow his business. However, the well-known Henry David Thoreau and the rest of the Thoreau family, down the street, were competitors in pencil making.",
	     "Welcome to Haines House! It was here that the Concord Academy that we know today got its start in 1922. However, Concord Academy began not as a girls\' high school in 1922, but as a co-ed elementary school around the corner on Belknap Street in 1916. Elite Concord families who hoped to have their children attend preparatory schools founded it to offer a more rigorous education than the local public elementary school provided. By 1922, students had started to age out of the school and parents wanted a local option for their daughters to continue a rigorous, if not entirely preparatory, education. While college was not a destination for all elite women at the time, it was an increasingly attractive and available option for young women who saw themselves in the \"New Woman\" movement of the 1920s. Designed primarily to serve a local student population, the fee structure used boarding tuition to subsidize day student attendance. Original day student fees ranged from $125 to $350 while boarding student tuition was $1500. Once the decision was made to open a high school on April 22nd of 1922, plans moved quickly. Haines house was bought on May 19th and Elise Hobson was hired as the new headmistress on May 27th. The high school opened in September of that year. In that first iteration, Haines House was used for classrooms, a dining hall, and teacher residences.",
             "The Chapel is the heart of today\'s CA. Nevertheless, it arrived at the school in a rather serendipitous manner. The story starts with the infamous 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston which claimed the lives of nearly 500 people. In the wake of that tragedy, more stringent fire regulations were imposed on all commercial and institutional buildings, including those at CA. To make the Assembly Hall--in what is now the lower portion of the Library--safer in the case of a fire, the local Fire Marshall insisted that the loose chairs then in use be attached to the floor. The recommended method for doing that was for the chairs to be attached to poles and the poles to be bolted to the floor. School leaders thought that would be too ugly and so they began a search for benches that could be attractively secured to the floor. CA wasn’t able to find used benches for sale in time and had to order brand new ones. But in the process of searching, a teacher came across an ad about an old Baptist church in New Hampshire that was to be sold along with its benches. Betty Hall drove up to check out the benches. What she found was something that she had been envisioning for the school for a while: a quiet meeting house. Using her own money, Hall bought the building, including its benches. Taking it apart, board by board, took three weeks, but with the help of several faculty members, one 9th grader, and 5 pet dogs, they managed (with the help of a crane) to achieve the onerous task in the summer of 1956. Since finding its place at CA, the chapel has undergone multiple renovations and additions, notable among which was the steeple, built by students during the winter of 1960-1961. The iconic bell was installed a year later. A major reconstruction was led by headmaster Jake Dresden and director of operations Don Kingman in 2004, which nearly doubled the chapel in size. When the renovation was complete, the chapel, now able to seat 420 people, had \"enhanced acoustics, improved light, a higher ceiling, and soaring beams.\"",
             "An iconic part of the chapel is this carved inscription: Paul\'s first letter to the Corinthians. This passage was traditionally read on the opening days of school. CA students carved them here in 1956. This carving is not, in fact, the first iteration. The original version turned out poorly. Molly Gregory, the woodcarving instructor, had assigned individual students their own line of the passage, resulting in visible differences between each line. Scrapping that first iteration, Gregory assigned individual students a single letter which they were responsible for carving throughout the entire piece. The result was consistency and beauty. Woodcarving students in subsequent years created many other items for the Chapel, including the altar of the chapel and this podium where CA faculty and students have been giving talks for decades. The acquisition of the Chapel and decisions about the physical plant of the school were part and parcel of the transformation that Betty Hall's leadership offered to CA. Before her tenure, CA was primarily what its founding families hoped for: a local school that would offer an intellectually stimulating education for daughters who may or may not go on to college educations. Betty Hall transformed the school into a rigorous preparatory school for girls, putting it on par with other nationally-known girls' schools and, in the process, frustrating and angering local parents whose daughters could no longer be assured of admissions. Betty Hall built the heart of the new CA, the Chapel, and put the school on the map.",
             "Mrs. Hall\'s changes to CA campus were not limited to building the Chapel. During her tenure, the Stufac was also transformed. Entering the Stufac, you might assume that it was always a dining hall, but you\'d be wrong. This was Concord Academy’s first gym. Prior to the 1950s, the dining hall was located in Russell Robb, an older building that was demolished to make way for the SHAC, while the current Stufac was instead used as a gymnasium. Primarily used for sports practice and games, the space also served as an auditorium. As you can see on your devices, the stage was set against the north wall. CA\'s first play, Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado, was performed here. After 1950, the gym went under major renovations, converting it into a dining hall. A second floor was constructed--now referred to as the upper stufac--as a place for students to be in each other’s company; students could take books from the newly installed bookshelves or hang out on couches with each other. Like the chameleon mascot that represents CA's adaptability, the school in its physical plant and in its national reach, reinvented itself in the second part of the 20th century.",
             "As it reached its fiftieth year, CA faced an existential crisis. If things had gone differently, it\'s entirely possible that the school would not exist today, that the houses along Main Street would be just that, residential houses, and it would have looked as though CA was never here. You may be asking yourself why? Well, in 1969, CA confronted the same quandary as other prep schools: what to do about the swelling wave of co-education that was transforming both university and secondary education? If we had left this campus, it\'s likely that this valuable real estate in the center of town would have become a neighborhood like the adjacent ones. Well, by 1969 the vast majority of all-boys and all-girls schools had gone or were planning to go co-ed; Concord was under pressure to follow suit. Various plans were considered, such as: exchanging students with other nearby schools, sharing nearby school grounds, becoming a co-ed school by itself, staying in an all-girls school, or, most drastically, merging with an all-boys school. Many girls\' schools decided to take the latter option. CA had lots of offers; Groton and Middlesex both pressed their suits hard. After long contemplation, school leaders decided to maintain CA\'s independence and become co-ed on its own. Co-education was a major change. Boys joined CA in 1971. On your device, you can see some photos of the first male students at CA. We thought it would be interesting to recreate these images with current students, in a world in which CA welcomes students of all genders.",
             "Along with co-education, CA experienced some of the social revolution that was rocking the world. Before becoming co-educational, CA had accepted its first students of color in 1963. Twelve years later, CA had dedicated its most famous dance, “Whiteout,” a Concord Academy tradition in which all the students wear white clothing to dance with a blacklight, to an equal rights movement for African Americans. At the time of the dance in 1975, all the junior girls coordinated to wear black to support the protests against racial injustice. CA decided to honor this night by continuing the tradition for junior girls wearing all black to signify CA’s commitment to equality for all its members and bring equality to everybody treated unjustly. This being one of our more famous forms of activism, we see CA continue to support equality worldwide. Later in 1988 CA started its first GSA. With the help of history teacher Kevin Jennings, Concord was able to represent students of the LGBTQ+ community. In comparison Phillips Academy Andover, was inspired by CA, which resulted in the formation of their GSA in 1989. In recent years, CA has supported the black lives movement, marched for climate change, and LGBTQ+ rights. CA has always been a school that values its community, even supporting its students as they help change the world one movement at a time.",
             "This is the site of one of the two original senior houses, one of the first, but failed attempts, at developing co-educational residences at Concord Academy. Ben Stumpf, now the computer science teacher at CA, lived in this Senior house while he was a student here. Today, CA residential life is grappling not just with how to best co-educate the houses, but how to accommodate and welcome boarding students who are trans or gender non-conforming into a boarding program that has traditionally conformed to the gender binary. The process has prompted the community to scrutinize the way that gender informs and shapes how we create and use social spaces on campus and come to new and more flexible approaches that fit the community that we are today and that affirm all of the students who call CA home.",
             "nothing",
             "Concord Academy\'s transition from a local elementary school, to a local girls' high school, to a national girls\' boarding school, to an international boarding and day school is the result of the love and commitment of its students, families, faculty, staff, and school leaders. Its footprint has expanded over time from its origins at 185 Main Street to stretch from the border of downtown at Wheeler House to the shore of the Sudbury River at Toad Hall, and the Moriarty Athletic Campus out at the old Arena Farms. The school continues to reimagine and reinvent itself with each new generation of students and adults. The immediate future will hopefully include a revitalization of West Campus and the building of the new Arts Building on the parking lot you see in front of you. It will be exciting to see how the next generation of Chameleons transforms this landscape and themselves."
